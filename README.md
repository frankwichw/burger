# Eat Da Burger
Eat Da Burger is an app that allows you to create and eat burgers at your leisure! You will be able to enter the name of the burger you would like, and see it added to a list on the left side of the page with a "Devour" button beside it. When you decide to devour the burger, press the button and the burger will be transported to the right side of the page where the now devoured list of burgers is.

## Getting Started

To get started, open your terminal, navigate to the burger directory, and then enter:
`npm install`
This will install all the node modules needed to run this program.
